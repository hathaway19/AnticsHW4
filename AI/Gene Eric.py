    #state as currentState which contains the board, accessed via 
    #currentState.board. The player will then return a list of 11 tuple 
    #coordinates (from their side of the board) that represent Locations 
    #to place the anthill and 9 grass pieces. In setup phase 2, the player 
    #will again be passed the state and needs to return a list of 2 tuple
    #coordinates (on their opponent's side of the board) which represent
    #Locations to place the food sources. This is all that is necessary to 
    #complete the setup phases.

    #Description: The getMove method corresponds to the play phase of the game

    #field for type (moveType) as well as field for relevant coordinate 
    #information (coordList). If for instance the player wishes to move an ant, 
    #they simply return a Move object where the type field is the MOVE_ANT constant 
    #and the coordList contains a listing of valid locations starting with an Ant 
    #and containing only unoccupied spaces thereafter. A build is similar to a move 
    #except the type is set as BUILD, a buildType is given, and a single coordinate 
    #is in the list representing the build location. For an end turn, no coordinates 
    #are necessary, just set the type as END and return.

    #Description: The getAttack method is called on the player whenever an ant completes 
    #a move and has a valid attack. It is assumed that an attack will always be made 
    #because there is no strategic advantage from withholding an attack. The AIPlayer 
    #is passed a copy of the state which again contains the board and also a clone of

    #these coordinates for a valid attack.
